Then we'll go with that data file! Say what? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Moving along… Shinier than yours, meatbag. One hundred dollars. Meh. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? __The alien mothership is in orbit here.__ *If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.* Checkmate.

## I can explain. It's very valuable.

I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Really?! No, I'm Santa Claus! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

1. Guess again.
2. Ask her how her day was.
3. Ow, my spirit!

### Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Daylight and everything. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

* I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!
* Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
* I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Actually, that's still true. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

You are the last hope of the universe. We're rescuing ya. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I had more, but you go ahead.

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! You can see how I lived before I met you.

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. A sexy mistake. No! Don't jump! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

Moving along… It doesn't look so shiny to me. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Bite my shiny metal ass. Actually, that's still true. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. How much did you make me? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
