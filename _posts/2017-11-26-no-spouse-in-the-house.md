As if I can forget, with the constant barrage of reminders, both indirect (knowledge of the event) and direct (the exact date of the event), whether it be 27 pieces of political spam mail in my mailbox in the past week, countless others the weeks before, spam text messages, word of mouth, Spotify, Google Doodles, Google Popups, and I'm probably forgetting some, tomorrow, Tuesday, November 8, 2016 is election day for the 2016 US presidential election.<!--more-->

<h3><strong>Absolutely Shameful, Spotify:</strong></h3>

I'm not sure why I didn't realize this before, but now I can't stop myself from thinking the following. <strong>Hillary Clinton should never have been allowed to run for president.</strong> I'm not saying this because she is a woman, but for an altogether different reason, one that is clear as day to me now. Her spouse was president before. That reason and that reason alone should preclude her from even thinking of running for president.

I say this for one simple reason, how do we know this isn't an elaborate scheme of Bill Clinton to install her as a puppet president, leaving him to pull the strings? I don't have anything against Bill Clinton. I have fond memories of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6TFGrCp9Zg">Bill on In Living Color</a>.

I could be president, serve two terms, leave and then be back in a few years with my wife being elected (puppet) president. I would serve as puppet master, really running the show, then divorce her when her term is up. I could then marry someone else bound for the White House. I could potentially be puppet master president forever!

The only way to prevent something like this from happening is to make it law. This would of course take Hillary out of the running, but the law is the law.
<h3>Proposed No Spouse In The House Law</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>If you served as president, your spouse (even after divorce) is precluded from ever running for president.</li>
 	<li>Even if your spouse is deceased you cannot run, as there can be no guarantee that you're not trying to carry out the will of the dead.</li>
</ol>
Don't get excited if you think you found a loophole, what is written above is merely a foothold into the heart of justice. The spirit and intent of those words are clear and will be given the proper legal treatment if turned into law.

Now you all know the truth, go forth and live more enlightened than you were before you read this glimpse behind the curtain, behind what they don't want you to see.
