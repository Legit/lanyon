I'm really more an apartment person. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

Tell him time is of the essence. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. __I have a dark side, too.__ *Somehow, I doubt that.* You have a good heart, Dexter.

I'm really more an apartment person. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm really more an apartment person.

1. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
2. I'm really more an apartment person.
3. I am not a killer.

I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I have a dark side, too. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

* I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.
* Like a sloth. I can do that.
* Cops, another community I'm not part of.

I am not a killer. Keep your mind limber. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

You all right, Dexter? I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

Only you could make those words cute. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Only you could make those words cute. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I am not a killer. Keep your mind limber.
