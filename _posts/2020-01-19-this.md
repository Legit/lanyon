Oh. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Bet your ass it works. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

Bet your ass it works. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Good morning, Mom. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
