title: No Man’s Sky Review

I played No Man's Sky for four or five days of casual gameplay. If I had to guess the number of hours I put in, not an exhaustive number, but a significant number of hours, sufficient to get a good grasp of the game. I wasn't playing with a premeditation of doing a review, but if you continue reading, you'll find out why I did a review.

I did not seek out any guides or tutorials of any kind. The most I did was read an article or two and watch a video or two about general aspects of the game before it came out. I wanted the experience to be fresh. I wanted to do the same thing for Minecraft when I first played it years ago, but I eventually failed miserably, a mistake I would not repeat this time. As of yet, I have not sought out any guides, nor will I. However, this doesn't prevent me from publicizing info that I would not seek out myself. That spoils nothing for me, however it might for you.

I pre-ordered No Man's Sky on Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 4:02 p.m. It was my first pre-order of a full game download. I didn't have to wait long, as the pre-order unlocked on Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 12:00 a.m. I don't know why I pre-ordered, but I did. I anticipated the launch, I even told a buddy, yeah it drops on Wednesday at midnight, turns out I was wrong, it was Tuesday at midnight and I was pleasantly surprised. I usually go to bed at 1 a.m. on weeknights, so it would have given me plenty of time to play starting from midnight.

Every day, I had fun recounting my nightly experiences to people I saw during the day. I don't remember playing that much each night, but after a few nights, I probably played more. I'm mentioning this to say that had I given more time, I would have done more each night and had more to say.

I remember my first experience, finding myself on a strange planet in a random point in an absolutely enormous universe, with a non-functional space craft, not knowing what the hell to do, or how to proceed. I was given a multi-tool, a device that allows me a myriad of options such as a mining beam, a laser with which you can mine elements you come across. That’s the main function of the tool, there are others, but I won't spoil it too much for you. I was able to upgrade my device, more on that later.

With my multi-tool in hand I walked aimlessly about, shooting my laser at random things, plants, rocks, etc., to extract their fundamental elements, carbon, iron, etc. My laser beam eventually gave out and at the time I didn't know how to recharge, so I was left with smashing it to get those elements, a much less efficient process, but it will do in a pinch.

I wandered way too far from my ship, but I made it back eventually. I fell into a cave, where I was greeted by these strange little creatures trying to make me meet my demise. The multi-tool also serves as a weapon, the same mining beam is an okay weapon. Don't worry, you will upgrade and get an actual weapon later on. I eventually made it back to my ship, eventually figured out that I could recharge everything, and you do need to recharge everything, your mining beam, your life support, elements from your ship. I take that back, one thing does not require replenishment. I will leave that as a surprise in the midst of all these spoilers.

I made it back to my ship, success! I was able to repair all the mechanics of my trusty craft. I attempted to launch, but then I needed to mine more elements to get **fuel**. That realization was frustrating, but ultimately it made sense and I came to terms with it. Eventually I was able to launch my vessel off that rock, out into the infinite abyss of space, eventually to other rocks. It's fun to discover new planets, name them, then fly around a newly discovered planet, looking for things to find. I even was joking around with a friend that I was at the beach, and if you know me you'll get the joke, later on I sent them a picture of my ship on a beach. I told them yeah, I left the beach on some planet. We both got a good chuckle out of it.

I was able to venture off to other solar systems. The game has a nice catalog of places you've visited. I've visited two systems and named five planets. There's even a nice space station where you can do other things. In fact, I'm at the space station now. More on that later. Speaking of that, I did promise to mention the upgrade of my multi-tool. I went from five to eight slots, I was able to increase the intensity of my mining laser, which means you can mine faster, but that also means it runs out of juice quicker. Refilling it is easy though. I was able to get a plasma grenade that also mines. I was even able to turn the multi-tool into a proper weapon.

So far, there hasn't been much combat. I did defeat five drones, one space craft and I think some poor defenseless creatures. Don't go into this game expecting to be shooting or killing a lot. At least that's not what I've encountered so far. Most planets are desolate, with sparse flora and fauna. In fact, upon landing, you are given four variables of the planet. Examples, **Weather**: Withered, **Sentinels:** Low, **Flora:** Frequent**, Fauna:** Devoid. One thing I don't like, the temperatures are in Celsius, with no way to change that it seems. It's not that big of a deal, but I would like to know the temperature of a planet I'm on. I refuse to do calculations for a game, that kills the fun.

Mining is fun, the laser hits a tree, it shakes and pretty soon you see these red chunks of stone come flying at you. Some things are harder to laser than others. All elements can be sold, some bought, only in certain places though. The colors of the planet I'm currently on, the one I started on, are funky, all red leaves on trees, a red sky, some mixed yellow and red, purple grass, green rocks, strange ominous looking stones protruding from the ground, a planet that looks **way** to close in the night sky of in the distance. The weirder something is the more it warrants investigation and probably the more valuable and more profitable an element that comes out of it is.

Exploring on foot is fun, up to a point. Unless you like walking back, it's probably not a good idea to veer too far from your ship. In order to cover more ground you can hover your craft over the planet and land most anywhere, but that comes at a price. You can quickly burn through the fuel necessary to launch your craft. Some things can be refueled by commonly found elements, such as carbon for your life support system. You need plutonium in order to power your precious (but taken for granted until you need it) launch thruster. Plutonium, isn't that common. Maybe you can purchase some and keep it handy, but what will probably happen to you is what I'm experiencing, walking around aimlessly looking for it. Then you find it, but realize you are quite far from your ship, so you have to walk very far back to it, which isn't that fun. I take that back, if you have your scanner functioning, it's not that difficult to obtain plutonium.

That brings me to what inspired me to write this in the first place, the fun factor. There are a lot of things that are fun in the beginning, mining, discovering new planets, naming them, traveling in your space ship, coming upon weird alien looking things and creatures, just marveling at the sheer size of this universe, the psychedelic colors of the planets. Well, not all planets are as colorful as others, which makes the colorful ones all the more colorful, so the dull planets have their places.

Then, my friends, there are things that are not so fun. It's apropos that I mentioned Minecraft earlier, because you do **a lot** of mining and a disproportionate amount of crafting. Mining to power your life support, or mining beam itself, your fuel, your ability to travel greater distances. Mining isn't so bad, at first. In the beginning I was delighted to find out that I could refuel my life support or my mining laser. And if it were just that, I'd be okay with it. Unless you're happy with traveling to just a few planets (out of the 18 quintillion in the universe) you're going to need your trusty Lightspeed Warp Drive, otherwise known as your Hyper Drive.

Without your hyperdrive, all the quintillion planets would just be distant stars in the backdrop, and in fact this game would be absolutely pointless without it. You charge this magical device with something called a warp cell. I was able to obtain one, I forgot how, but it ran out and it also needs antimatter, which is ridiculously expensive, but then later you learn how to craft it yourself. But I digress, back to the warp cell, it requires 100 units of Thamium9, which is mined through asteroids in space with your ship, this is very plentiful and very easy to obtain once you get in space. The next component of a warp cell is antimatter, as I said it's very expensive before you learn how to make it. I was able to purchase my first unit of antimatter be selling a lot of my resources to a trader. So you figure, great Thamium9 is plentiful, I can craft Antimatter, then here's the rub. Antimatter is made up of the following: Electron Vapor, Heridu & Zinc.

I now find myself at a space station, at the Galactic Trade Terminal. Electron Vapor is available to purchase for 44,343 units, but I just so happened upon an element earlier that was very valuable, Emeril. Emeril is valued at 275 units for each piece. So, I sold my Emeril to buy some Electron Vapor. Heridium is cheap. You can purchase one piece for 32 unites. Zinc is 103 units for one piece. Zinc is readily available on planets, but just in case you can purchase one here. So great, I got all my necessary elements together and I make one piece of antimatter. I combine that with my Thamium9 and I have my warp cell. I then charge my hyperdrive with my warp cell and find that it didn't increase all that much.

My point is that a lot of tedium is required to get anywhere in this game. Tedium that isn't rewarded with much action. Sure, it's fun in the beginning, but most things are just because they are new. And yes, I know I'm potentially missing out on amazing things out there in the universe. 18 quintillion planets must surely reveal tons of awesome spectacles. But you see an amazing thing, then you do the same thing over and over, mine this, mine that, mine some more to travel more. I don't care if I'm missing out on adventures or galactic sights that will boggle my mind, I **refuse** to wade through any more tedium in this game.
